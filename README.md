## React Test Website

I wanted to learn ReactJS and I thought the best way to go about it would be to create a test portfolio page using React. Using packages like "styled-components" and "react-motion," I created a fun little page with React. It's not all that responsive yet, but I learned a lot of new stuff about React through this project.
